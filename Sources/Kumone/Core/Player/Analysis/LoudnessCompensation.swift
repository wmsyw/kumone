/// Cross-track loudness compensation: one constant playback gain per song, so
/// two songs meeting at a hand-over arrive at the same perceived level.
///
/// Pain point ④ of docs/automix-research-notes.md — "the next song is suddenly
/// 6 dB louder" — is a *mastering* difference, not a transition bug. No fade
/// curve can fix it, because both sides of the curve are wrong by a constant.
/// The fix is walkywalker's: a per-track trim applied to the whole song
/// (`dj.cpp:18-24` / `tune.cpp:153-173`), with Sony's clip guard on top
/// (`utils_data_normalization.py:79-80`).
///
/// ### Absolute, not pairwise
///
/// The trim is a function of **one** track: `target − referenceLoudness`. It is
/// deliberately not "match the incoming song to the outgoing one", because a
/// deck is loaded before the player knows what follows it, and a pairwise trim
/// would have to change under a running song when the queue changes. An
/// absolute target makes the trim a property of the loaded track, fixed for as
/// long as it plays — which is also why `PlaybackEngine` takes it as a
/// load-time argument and never as a setter.
///
/// ### Attenuate freely, boost barely
///
/// Modern masters sit well above −14 LUFS, so almost every trim is a cut, and a
/// cut is always safe. A boost is capped at `maxBoostDB` (+3 dB) *and* held to
/// whatever headroom the track's own peak leaves — a quiet master with a hot
/// peak gets no boost at all. What a boost cannot recover is exactly the
/// residual the planner's loudness gate still sees (see
/// `TransitionPlanner.signals`).
