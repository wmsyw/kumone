// Beat-synchronous structure segmentation (predev §2.1). Pure vDSP, no model,
// and — this is the constraint that shapes everything below — **no second pass
// over the audio**. Every number here is derived from the per-frame log-mel,
// chroma and low-band arrays `TrackAnalyzer.stftFeatures` already produced, plus
// the beat grid it already tracked.
//
// Pipeline (Foote 2000, with the usual modern trimmings):
//   1. pool the per-frame features by beat and z-score each dimension, so a
//      4-minute song becomes a ~500-row matrix and everything after this is
//      microseconds;
//   2. beat × beat cosine self-similarity, timbre and chroma weighted equally
//      (after z-scoring they are already on a common scale);
//   3. slide a Gaussian-tapered checkerboard kernel down the diagonal → a
//      novelty curve whose peaks are "the music changed here";
//   4. peak-pick, snap to downbeats, cluster the resulting spans by their mean
//      feature vector (threshold-based agglomeration — the number of distinct
//      section *types* is what we are trying to learn, so fixing k is wrong);
//   5. label the clusters by repetition × energy × vocal density.
//
// The output is deliberately fragile-by-default: anything the confidence blend
// does not clear comes back as *no sections at all*, because a wrong boundary is
// worse for cue selection than no boundary (predev §4.1) — a mislabelled "chorus
// ends here" cuts a song off mid-climax, while an absent one just falls back to
// the energy heuristics that shipped before this existed.
