// Beat/energy analysis, pure vDSP/Accelerate (spec §4). No third-party code.
//
// Pipeline: STFT (1024/256, Hann) → 40-band log-mel → spectral flux onset
// envelope → autocorrelation + log-normal tempo prior → BPM, then dynamic
// programming (Ellis 2007) for the beat grid, low-frequency voting for
// downbeats, and RMS-based structure features (phrases, intro, outro).
//
// The same pass also feeds `StructureSegmenter` (v7), which turns the per-beat
// log-mel/chroma into a self-similarity matrix and hands back `sections` —
// intro/verse/chorus/… — or nothing at all when it is not confident.
//
// The same STFT pass also feeds two tonal/timbral estimators: a peak-picked
// chromagram → Krumhansl-Schmuckler template matching for the key, and a
// four-feature vocal-activity detector.
//
// Vocal activity (v5). The three mono-spectral cues that shipped in v4 —
// vocal-band energy share, band spectral flatness, 2–8 Hz syllable/vibrato
// modulation — could not tell "a harmonic instrument sitting in the mid band"
// (sax, distorted guitar, a synth lead) from "someone singing"; validated
// against StemKit separation on the eval corpus, v4's top-scored windows often
// held essentially no real vocal energy. v5 adds one cheap, orthogonal cue
// (docs/automix-stems-predev.md §7.3), pure vDSP:
//   • Mid/side centre ratio — lead vocals sit at the stereo centre (mid=L+R),
//     accompaniment and effects spread wider (side=L−R); the vocal band's mid
//     share is high when a centred voice is present. Needs the stereo signal,
//     so `analyze(fileAt:)` decodes L/R in parallel with the mono pass (a
//     second, band-energy-only FFT sweep — see `stereoVoiceEnergies`). The
//     mono `analyze(samples:)` test entry has no stereo image and skips it.
//
// §7.3's other proposal, an HPSS harmonic share (Fitzgerald 2010 median-filter
// harmonic/percussive separation over the vocal band), was implemented and
// measured against the same ground truth and did NOT survive: its standalone
// correlation with per-second vocal/mix energy was +0.015, and a weight search
// under leave-one-playlist-out CV drove its weight to ~0 in all six folds.
// Sustained harmonic energy in 200 Hz–4 kHz is as much guitar/synth/strings as
// voice, so it adds nothing the band and tonality cues do not already carry. It
// was removed rather than left at weight 0 because it was by far the most
// expensive part of the analysis (a per-bin double median filter, plus
// retaining the whole vocal-band spectrogram). Recoverable from git history if
// a future cue wants it.
