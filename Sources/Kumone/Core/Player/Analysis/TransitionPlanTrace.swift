// A decision ledger for `TransitionPlanner.plan`.
//
// `beatMatched` is the conjunction of a dozen gates — the tier's own three
// signals, the key demotion, both tempo confidences, the folded BPM delta, the
// per-deck rate bend, an in point, and then a bar-length search with its own
// ceiling / out-point / steadiness / vocal rules. When a real corpus produces
// almost no beat-matched hand-overs, *which* of those gates did the killing is
// the only question worth asking first, and the plan alone cannot answer it.
//
// So the planner can be asked to keep a ledger while it decides. Two rules make
// this safe to have in production code:
//
//   * **Zero behaviour change.** Nothing here is read back by the planner. The
//     ledger is written by `note`, which returns the same Bool the `guard` it
//     wraps was already testing, so evaluation order and short-circuiting are
//     exactly what they were.
//   * **Zero cost when unasked.** The tracing parameter is an
//     `inout PlanTrace?`, and every recording site builds its numbers and its
//     text inside `@autoclosure`s that are never called while the trace is nil.
//     The product path calls the untraced overload and pays for one nil check
//     per gate.

/// One gate on the road to a beat-matched hand-over: what it measured, what it
/// was held to, and whether the pair got through.
