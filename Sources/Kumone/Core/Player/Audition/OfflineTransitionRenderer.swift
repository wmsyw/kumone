            //
            // - The **rate and the pad go on now**, not at the overlap. The
            //   unit pre-pulls `maximumFrameCount` input frames ahead of its
            //   output, so a rate written at the overlap would have the head of
            //   the incoming track already pulled at unity — the first ~48 ms
            //   of the incoming song played at the wrong tempo and then a step.
            //   Written here there is no step at all: the unit runs at the
            //   plan's rate for the whole render, over a player that is silent
            //   until the seam, so nothing but the seam can hear it.
            // - Which means the player's clock and the rendered clock run at
            //   different speeds, and the frame the buffer is scheduled at is
            //   on the *player's*: `overlapStartFrames × incomingRate`.

            // tidiness. They are written at the *player*, upstream of the
            // pre-pull, so leaving them at the overlap would let the deck's
            // first pre-pulled `maximumFrameCount` frames — the head of the
            // incoming song — be pulled at full level and only then be told to
            // be silent: an audible blip exactly at the seam. Under the old
