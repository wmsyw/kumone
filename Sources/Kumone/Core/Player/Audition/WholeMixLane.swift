// Whole-mix gain lanes: the one new rendering capability a score needs
// (predev §2.2).
//
// A `StemEnvelope` lane can already write a step — two breakpoints a few
// milliseconds apart — but it is a *stem* lane, so writing one costs a
// separation pass per side, and a full-band gesture (a cut, a bar of silence)
// wants nothing separated at all. Paying ~30 s of Metal time to make one beat
// quiet is absurd. So this is the same idea one layer up: a per-sample gain on
// each side's **whole mix**, applied to the source buffer before a sample is
// pulled through the graph, with no separator anywhere near it.
//
// The other difference from the stem lanes is resolution. `StemTechniqueLayer`
// evaluates its curves on the automation's own 50 Hz control grid and
// interpolates, which is right for a curve and wrong for a cut: 20 ms of
// interpolation *is* the flam the whole score model exists to avoid. These
// lanes are evaluated per sample, so a breakpoint lands on the frame it names.

/// A gain curve on one side's whole mix, in **overlap-relative seconds**.
///
/// Between breakpoints the gain is a raised cosine in *amplitude* rather than
/// linear in dB: a cut edge runs from unity to −60 dB in 8 ms, and dB-linear
/// over that span spends most of it inaudible while the last millisecond does
/// all the work — which is a click with extra steps. The raised cosine is the
/// physical shape of a DJ's fader hand, which is what an edge is imitating.
///
/// An **empty lane is pass-through**, and so is a lane of nothing but 0 dB.
