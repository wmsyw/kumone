// The listening-feedback corpus: one JSON object per line in
// `~/Library/Application Support/Kumone/automix-feedback.jsonl`.
//
// A listening test produces one durable thing — somebody's verdict on a
// particular hand-over — and until now that lived in a notebook, if anywhere.
// A line here pairs the verdict with everything needed to reproduce and
// re-judge the seam later: which two tracks, what was planned, what actually
// ran, which gesture, which path, which debug overrides were on, and a
// fingerprint of the calibration in force. That is the difference between "the
// vocal exchange sounded bad once" and a row a sweep can join against.
//
// **Schema stability matters more than schema beauty.** These lines outlive
// the code that wrote them, so every line carries `"v"`, fields are only ever
// added, and the encoder is pinned by a round-trip test. Anything that changes
// meaning gets a new version, never a re-used key.
//
// This file is the only thing the debug panel writes to disk. The overrides
// deliberately do not persist; a mark does.
