    /// beat-match — is left exactly as it was).

    /// ### The problem it fixes
    ///
    /// The symmetric law runs both faders as equal-power curves across the
    /// *whole* overlap while the staged EQ simultaneously carves the two decks
    /// into complementary halves of the spectrum. Over a 30 s blend that means
    /// that at the swap both decks sit at −3 dB *and* each holds only part of

    /// owns the floor and the mix audibly collapses — strong, weak, strong.
    /// Two half-spectra at −3 dB do not add back up to one track.
    ///
    /// ### The law
    ///
    /// What a DJ does instead is keep exactly one deck dominant at all times:
    ///
    ///   - **outgoing** holds full level (bar the courtesy dip) all the way to
    ///     the swap, then leaves over what is left of the overlap;
    ///   - **incoming** climbs quickly to `preSwapPlateau` and *waits* there,
    ///     underneath — low-cut by the staged EQ, so it adds presence without
    ///     mud — reaching unity exactly at the swap, where the EQ hands it the
    ///     low end and it becomes the dominant deck.
    ///
    /// Both curves are smoothstepped and meet their pieces at equal values, so
    /// the result is continuous in value *and* slope: the engine writes these
    /// at 50 Hz and any step is a click.
    ///
    /// ### Headroom
    ///
    /// Both decks are near full around the swap, which is the one thing this
    /// law could plausibly break. It does not, because the staged EQ is doing
    /// the opposite thing at the same time: by the swap the outgoing deck is
    /// down −24/−18/−24 across all three bands, so its contribution to the sum
    /// is small exactly where its fader is highest, and before that the two
    /// decks hold complementary bands. Measured on the offline renders of two
    /// real seams at the shipped trims and ride, sample peak across swap ± 2 s
    /// on the player path (i.e. with the offline renderer's blind-test
    /// normalization undone):
    ///
    /// | seam | symmetric | dominant | margin |
    /// |---|---|---|---|
    /// | Kendrick "LOVE." → "Pray For Me" | −5.49 dBFS | −3.37 dBFS | 3.37 dB |
    /// | Kelela "Happy Ending" → "On the Run" | −5.91 dBFS | −4.23 dBFS | 4.23 dB |
    ///
    /// The law costs about 2 dB of peak, which is the point — it is 2 dB the
    /// old curve was throwing away in the middle — and lands three to four dB
    /// clear of full scale, so the plateau stays at 0.85.
