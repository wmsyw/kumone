// for a current track A and a candidate B this runs `TransitionPlanner.plan`
// — the very pure function that will decide the real hand-over — and scores
// the pair by the *tier of transition it came back with*. A high score
// therefore means "a good transition is actually reachable for this pair",
// not "some proxy metric likes it".
//
// Everything in this file is a pure function of its arguments. The stateful
// half (which candidates are downloaded, what has lost how many rounds) lives
// in `QueueOrderSelector`; the offline `Audition.orderBaseline` family drives
// this file directly, so the numbers an offline report prints are the numbers
// the player picks on.
