// The stateful half of the AutoMix queue-reorder mode
// (docs/automix-queue-predev.md §2.2 / §2.4). The arithmetic lives in
// `QueueOrderScoring.swift`; what is here is bookkeeping — which candidates
// are in the pool, which have an analysis in hand, which one is being fetched,
// and how many rounds each has lost.
//
// **The acquisition policy is satisficing escalation.** A pick starts from
// every analysis already in hand and stops the instant one of them is good
// enough (`config.satisfyingTier`, "beat-matched or better"). Only when none
// is does it start paying, in exponentially growing rounds down the remaining
// queue — 1 track, then 4, then 16 — stopping mid-round the moment something
// satisfies. The fixed W=4 window this replaced was measured worthless on a
// real cache (13 % beat-matched at list order vs 16 % at W=4 vs 53 % with the
// whole analyzed pool): the value was never in the window, it was in the pool
// being rich, and the sidecars each round leaves behind make it richer for
// every later pick.
//
// **Nothing in this file exists while the mode is off.** `PlayerService` holds
// the selector as an optional and only builds one when the queue order is
// `.autoMix`, so a player in `.listed` or `.shuffled` runs the code it always
// ran, allocates nothing extra and issues no request.

/// Which order the player walks its queue in — the three-state upgrade of the
/// old `shuffleEnabled: Bool` (predev §2.1).
///
/// Mutually exclusive by construction: there is one value, so "turning AutoMix
/// order on turns shuffle off" is not a rule anybody has to remember to apply.
/// The raw `queue` is never reordered by any of them, so leaving a mode always
/// restores the list the user actually gave us.
