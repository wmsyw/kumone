// The AutoMix queue-reorder mode's arithmetic and bookkeeping
// (docs/automix-queue-predev.md). Three properties carry the whole design and
// each gets its own test:
//
//   - **the tier dominates**. A stylistically perfect pair that can only be
//     crossfaded must never outrank a pair that can be beat-matched, or the
//     mode is optimising a proxy instead of the thing it claims to optimise.
//   - **aging is unbounded**. "Every track gets played" has to be a property
//     of the arithmetic, not a hope: keep losing and you eventually outrank a
//     whole tier.
//   - **mode off changes nothing**. The three-state replaces a Bool that has
//     been persisted for as long as the app has existed, so a session written
//     before the mode came back exactly as it was.
//
// No engine is constructed anywhere in here: the scorer is a pure function and
// the selector's bookkeeping is reachable without a player.
